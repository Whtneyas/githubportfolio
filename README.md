# PORTFOLIO FOR GITHUB 
 


 ## Project 
 
This project has been assigned to us by the school with the objective of creating a portfolio for GitHub. The project entails the utilization of skills acquired during the recent course, where we are expected to apply these skills to our project. The portfolio to be created will provide an overview of my GitHub profile, including all the projects I have starred and my repositories. It is mandatory for the portfolio to be designed as a single page.
